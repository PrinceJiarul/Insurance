    <section>
        <h2>1. Definition & Nature of Insurance</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Insurance is a financial agreement between two parties — the insurer (insurance
            company) and the insured (individual or organization) — where the insurer promises to compensate for a
            specific loss, damage, illness, or death in return for a fixed premium.</p>
        <div class="example">Example: You pay a yearly premium to an insurance company for health insurance. If you are
            hospitalized, the company pays your medical bills as per the policy.</div>
        <h3>Nature:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><strong>Contractual agreement:</strong> <br>Insurance is a legally binding contract, governed by the
                Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the Insurance Act, 1938.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk transfer mechanism:</strong><br> Insurance helps to transfer the financial burden of
                uncertain future events (like fire, theft, accident, or death) from the insured to the insurer.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual cooperation:</strong><br> A large number of people pay premiums, forming a pool. The
                insurer uses this pool to compensate those who suffer a loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment for contingencies:</strong><br> Insurance pays only when a certain event (death, damage,
                illness) occurs. If the event doesn't happen, the insurer keeps the premium.</li>
            <li><strong>Not profit-making:</strong><br> It is not meant to make profit for the insured, only to cover
                the financial loss suffered.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Origin & Development of Insurance in India</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>Ancient India: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elements of insurance existed in ancient Indian texts such as Manusmriti and Dharmashastra where merchants shared risks during sea voyages.</li>
                    <li>In ancient times, loss sharing among traders and village communities was common.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <h3>Modern insurance in India </h3>
            <li>1818 – Oriental Life Insurance Co. (Calcutta): First life insurance company.</li>
            <li>1870 – British Companies Dominated: Only catered to Europeans, not Indians.</li>
            <li>1912 – Indian Life Insurance Companies Act: First legislation to regulate life insurance.</li>
            <li>1938 – Insurance Act: Brought both life and general insurance under one regulation.</li>
            <li>1956 – Nationalization of Life Insurance:
                <ul>
                    <li>LIC was formed by merging 245 private insurers.</li>
                    <li>Government controlled life insurance to protect policyholders.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1972 – Nationalization of General Insurance:
                <ul>
                    <li>Formation of GIC (General Insurance Corporation) and its subsidiaries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1999 – IRDA Act:
                <ul>
                    <li>Establishment of IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) to allow private players and regulate them.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2000s Onward – Liberalization:
                <ul>
                    <li>Private and foreign insurers entered the Indian market.</li>
                    <li>Now India has both public and private insurance providers.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>3. Kinds of Insurance</h2>
        <p>Insurance can be broadly classified into two categories:</p>
        <h3>A. Life Insurance</h3>
        <p>This type of insurance covers the risk associated with the life of a human being. It provides financial protection to the family or nominee in case of the insured person's death. It also serves as a savings and investment tool in some cases.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Term Insurance:</strong> A pure life cover policy that provides a large sum assured at low premium for a fixed term. If the policyholder dies during the term, the sum is paid to the nominee. No maturity benefit is given if the insured survives.</li>
          <li><strong>Endowment Policy:</strong> This provides both risk coverage and savings. If the policyholder survives the term, a lump sum is paid. If they die during the term, the nominee gets the sum assured.</li>
          <li><strong>Whole Life Policy:</strong> Provides coverage for the entire life of the insured. The sum assured is paid only after the death of the policyholder.</li>
          <li><strong>Money Back Policy:</strong> Offers periodic payments during the policy term plus final maturity benefits, making it a mix of insurance and income.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>B. General Insurance</h3>
        <p>This type of insurance covers risks other than life. It is usually short-term and compensates for actual loss incurred. General insurance is crucial for businesses, vehicles, health, travel, and property protection.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fire Insurance:</strong> Provides compensation for damage caused by fire to property such as buildings, stock, furniture, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Marine Insurance:</strong> Covers goods, cargo, and ships from the risk of loss or damage during sea transport. It has three types: cargo insurance, hull insurance, and freight insurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Motor Insurance:</strong> Covers damages or losses arising from vehicle accidents, theft, or third-party liabilities. It is mandatory in India to have third-party motor insurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Offers coverage against medical expenses like hospitalization, surgeries, or doctor consultation. It may be individual or family floater based.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> Covers risks during travel like trip cancellation, baggage loss, passport loss, or medical emergencies abroad.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">Example: A person having a motor insurance policy gets reimbursement for repairs after a road accident.</div>

        <h2>4. Principles of Insurance (Core Concepts)</h2>
        <p>These principles ensure fairness and proper functioning of insurance:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li><strong>Utmost Good Faith (Uberrima Fides):</strong><br>
                Both insurer and insured must disclose all relevant information truthfully.<br>
                <em>Failure = contract becomes void.</em><br>
                <div class="example">Example: If someone hides their heart disease from the insurer, their claim can be denied later.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Insurable Interest:</strong><br>
                The insured must suffer financial loss if the insured item/person is lost/damaged.<br>
                <em>Without insurable interest, the contract is invalid.</em><br>
                <div class="example">Example: You can insure your own house, not your neighbor’s.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Indemnity:</strong><br>
                Applies to general insurance.<br>
                The insured is restored to the original financial position before the loss. No profit allowed.<br>
                <div class="example">Example: If your insured TV worth ₹30,000 is damaged, the insurer pays ₹30,000 or the current market value — not more.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contribution:</strong><br>
                If the same subject is insured with multiple insurers, all will share the loss proportionately.<br>
                <div class="example">Example: Two fire policies of ₹1 lakh each. If loss is ₹50,000, both companies pay ₹25,000 each.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Subrogation:</strong><br>
                After paying the claim, the insurer gets the legal right to recover the loss from a third party responsible for the damage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximate Cause:</strong><br>
                The immediate, effective cause of loss must be covered by the policy.<br>
                <div class="example">Example: If fire is caused by lightning, and the policy excludes lightning, claim will be denied.</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Loss Minimization:</strong><br>
                The insured must take all reasonable steps to reduce the loss.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. Importance of Insurance</h2>
        <h3>🔹 Economic Importance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encourages Savings:</strong> Life insurance promotes regular savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital Formation:</strong> Insurers invest premium money in infrastructure, helping economic growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Supports Businesses:</strong> Reduces risks in business activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Investment:</strong> Investors feel confident when risk is covered.</li>
            <li><strong>Provides Long-Term Funds:</strong> Infrastructure projects get funding from insurance companies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🔹 Social Importance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Security:</strong> Protects families from sudden financial loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Helps in Natural Disasters:</strong> Insurance helps people recover after floods, earthquakes, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare Protection:</strong> Health insurance reduces medical burdens.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Schemes:</strong> Insurance is part of schemes like PMJAY, Ayushman Bharat, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Understanding:</em> Insurance is not just a financial tool but a social and economic stabilizer, ensuring security and promoting growth.</p>
